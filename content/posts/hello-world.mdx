# Hello World

Welcome to my new blog! This is an example post written in MDX to demonstrate the portfolio/blog functionality.

## What you'll find here

This site showcases:

- **Projects**: A collection of my work and side projects
- **Blog posts**: Technical articles, tutorials, and thoughts
- **About**: Information about my background and skills

## Built with modern tools

This portfolio is built using:

- Next.js 16 with App Router
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- MDX for rich content
- Framer Motion for subtle animations

The site is designed to be fast, accessible, and maintainable. All content is written in Markdown/MDX and automatically processed for the web.
